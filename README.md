# coupleCoC_plus
#This is the coupleCoC+ algorithm in the paper "coupleCoC+: a information-theoretic co-clustering-based transfer learning framework for the integrative clustering of single-cell genomic data" by Pengcheng Zeng and Zhixiang Lin. Because it draws on the code of STC algorithm, please also refer to the STC code at https://github.com/sykim122/STC. Note that because the coupleCoC_plus algorithm requires the random initialization, the clustering results might not be exactly the same as those presented in the paper.

(1) Please run "real_data_results.m" to show the results by coupleCoC+ algorithm for the third real example in the paper.
